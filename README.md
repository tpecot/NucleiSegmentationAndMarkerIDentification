# NucleiSegmentationAndMarkerIDentification

These Jupyter notebooks allow to use 3 different deep learning architectures (Mask R-CNN, Incpetion-V3 and U-Net) to segment nuclei. These approaches have been tuned to be efficient in a complex tissue, he mouse intestinal epithelium, with a small dataset.

Marker identification is also performed using an Inception-V3 architecture.
